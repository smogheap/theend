All right, feelin' better after some beers.  I'm kinda up, but probably not in the greatest shape to take on the stasis rig right now.  Guess that means more captain's log blatherings.  Lucky you!

So here I am, all talkative and sloshy, with nobody to talk to, and nothing to talk about.

Hey there's an Idea.  every time I say "nothing" or "nobody", I'm gonna take another swig.

Ok, so I should probably explain my situation a bit.  'Cause you know, anyone will ever read this or care.  I was on the proverbial three-hour tour, taking this piece of junk out to Jupiter and back.  From Earth.  Like some alien is gonna know "Oh yeah, Earth, by that dim star a bazillion miles past the quickEmart".  Anyway Rob and I built this ship out of an old military recon vessel.  We've been hacking on it basically since we met in college.

...Know what?  "nobody".  Drink time dammit.

So we passed inspections and got ooo path clearance... (That's out-of-orbit, 'cause aliens would totally want to learn English and acronyms.)  Anyway Rob decided to sit out the maiden voyage.  I suspect his new girlfriend might have had something to do with that, but whatever.  Out past Keplar, around Jupiter and back.  That was the idea.

"Nobody".  Really thought I'd say that more.   Mmm beer.

The outpost on io hailed and had some problem checking my ooo path, but said I could continue.  On my way around the dark side of jupiter, the ship's sensors logged a crapload of readings, which i'm sure would mean something to a scientist.  Lots of energy on lots of bands, to me it just looks like background noise, magnified like a billion times.  once i was clear of jupiter, there was nothing.

nobody.

whatever happened, happened quick.  io outpost was dark even to pings.  net's gone, even inside keplar.  keplar, which is really cloudy now.  even offline positioning is useless.  doesn't recognize sol.  it's a real good day when the friggin' sun is screwed up.  i can see the damn thing on the monitor, but navigation doesn't detect it as sol.  and where the inner planets were...

nothing.

not nothing, though i ';l drink some more, but vapor.  devris.  spreading out and becoming bands, ring.s
