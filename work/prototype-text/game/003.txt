uff.  forgot how much i hate hangovers.

had a freaking dream about the stasis rig.  really not looking forward to going in that thing.  but my supplies won't last a lot longer.  and, i think i figured out why the cycler was getting air in it.

jeez, i can see the headlines now.  last man alive kills himself in busted stasis rig he was too dumb to fix.  i'm totally going to print that out and stick it on the side panel.  when this thing is picked up by little green men and they happen upon my corpse all riddled with tubes they should at least get the feeling i had it coming.

anyway nothing to report.  drinking way more of the water reserves than i should.
