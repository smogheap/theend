"The End", the story of the last human alive, is an idea we (penduin, minego)
have been batting around for a while.  Whether it ever takes form as a movie,
a web series, a comic, an interactive adventure game, something else entirely
or any combination of the above, it's a nugget of a concept that's been fun to
play with.

We've written several screenplay-style starts and snippets, and will probably
keep doing more.  No two versions agree entirely on any specific details, and
we have no "canon" as yet.  Some are worth the time it takes to read them more
than others.  But, we've got smogheap now.  So I'm throwing in what we've got
and we (or someone) will sort it out (or not) sometime.  :^)
