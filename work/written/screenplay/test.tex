\intslug[day]{Driskill Hotel Seminar Room}
JOE and APRIL burst through the doors into a clean, well-lit
seminar room.
\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
Are we in time?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{April}
How could they start without us?
We're the main attraction.
\end{dialogue}
Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the
front of the room.
\begin{dialogue}[looking about the room]{Joe}
We are?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{April}
Don't be a moron.  You know we've
been invited to Austin to discuss
script format.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
But why is the room empty?
\end{dialogue}
April and Joe both look out across the room~-- rows of empty
chairs and nary a person in sight.
\begin{dialogue}{April}
Okay, okay, don't panic.
\end{dialogue}
She takes three deep breaths.  Then she looks at her watch
and smiles.
\begin{dialogue}[continuing]{April}
We're an hour early.\dots  We should
rehearse.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Joe}
Okay, you start.  Margins?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{April}
Left, 1.5 inches.  Right, 1.0
inches.  Top, 1.0 inches to the
body, 0.5 inches to the number.
Bottom, 0.5 to 1.5 inches,
depending on where the page break
comes.
