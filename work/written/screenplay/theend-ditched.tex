\intslug[]{Spaceship}
The floor curves upwards in a complete circle; the craft's spin is used for artificial gravity.  The ship is a patchwork. Panels are out of place, wires and tubes and racks of parts and half-finished projects seem to be everywhere.  The front wall slopes out in a cone shape, and the back wall is flat.  The ship measures roughly 15' front to back, and 20' across.

Like much of the interior, the back wall is covered by various panels and wiring.  It also has a large door and a stasis pod.  The back wall's stripped layout is more similar to a floor than a side wall.

Lights flicker, and a monitor can be seen displaying an error message:
\begin{dialogue}[on-screen]{Doc}
WARNING: Electrical failure!
Panel 0: 0.0 Volts
\end{dialogue}
The stasis pod's magnetic lock disengages.  Its door swings open slowly and heavily.  MAN, unconscious, falls out onto the floor, along with several gallons of fluid and some medical apparatus.
\begin{dialogue}[groaning]{Man}
Whe...?
\end{dialogue}
MAN makes a weak attempt to lift his head from the floor.  MAN throws up violently and passes out, landing in the mess of crushed medical gear, stasis fluid, and vomit.
\fadeout
\fadein
An unknown amount of time has passed and MAN is again trying to get up.  The only lights on are an emergency bulb and a computer monitor.

MAN eventually makes his way to the sole active monitor.
\begin{dialogue}[very gruffly]{Man}
Hey doc.  What's up?
\end{dialogue}
MAN waits as if expecting a response.  When he gets none, he taps impatiently on the monitor.
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Doc?  You alive?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[on-screen]{Doc}
DOC system active.
Powersave mode.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Powersave... is that what the silent treatment's about?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[on-screen]{Doc}
Testing audio systems... [PASS]
Speakers may be off, disconnected, or damaged.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Fuck.
\end{dialogue}
MAN reaches behind a panel and finds a speaker.  He reconnects a wire that has come loose.  He then tosses the speaker back behind the panel.
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Better?
\end{dialogue}
A short tone is heard.
\begin{dialogue}[aloud, synthetic voice]{Doc}
Speaker output has been restored.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Good.  Where are we?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Unknown.  Minimal power is available.  External cameras are inactive.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Lovely.  What do I need to fix?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Solar panel 0 may be disconnected or damaged.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[digesting bad news]{Man}
So I've got to climb out there.  Let me guess, I've got to retract the sails by hand too?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Insufficient power remains to fully retract the sails.  Manual retraction will be required.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Next time just say ``yes''.
\end{dialogue}
\extslug[]{Spaceship}
The ship is spinning.  In shots grounded to MAN's actions on the craft, stars in the background move by dizzyingly.

MAN is exiting through a door on the back side of the ship's nosecone.  He is wearing a space suit that appears to have been pieced together from several sources.  The main suit is orange, but one arm is blue, and the helmet is red.  One of the legs is bunched up as if it is longer than the other.

MAN closes the door and begins pulling himself along the main support pole that runs the length of the sail.  He reaches the first set of sails, inserts a hand crank, and slowly starts turning it.

Eventually all the sails are retracted and MAN is able to reach the end of the pole.  As he advances along, minor damage to the sails and evidence of the ship's hand-made nature are visible.  Exposed wires run the length of the pole and are held in place with duct tape and zip ties.  Some welds holding the sails' rods are sloppy.

At the end of the pole is a flat disc with a solar panel 3' across and an antenna.  The disc is dented and scraped as if by a bullet.  MAN fiddles with the panel's wires for a moment until a small LED on the back of the disc lights up.
\begin{dialogue}[over radio to MAN's helmet]{Doc}
Solar panel 0 is active.  External cameras are online.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
All right.  Now figure out where we are.
\end{dialogue}
MAN begins climbing back towards the cone.
\begin{dialogue}[over radio]{Doc}
Location determined at 93 per cent probability.  Location is 1536.34 light years from Earth, approaching the Deneb system.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[laughing loudly]{Man}
Right!  Stupid computer.  What's the next best match, and just out of curiosity, what was the 7 per cent error?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[over radio]{Doc}
No other locations can be calculated.  The 7 per cent possibility of error is due to the absence of light from Sol.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[confused, then very scared]{Man}
What?
\end{dialogue}
CUT TO BLACK

OPENING SEQUENCE
\fadein
MAN is still in his frankenstein space suit.  He is wildly digging through one of the ship's refrigeration units.
\begin{dialogue}[very agitated]{Man}
Where the hell is the -
\end{dialogue}
MAN opens an adjacent refrigerator.
\begin{dialogue}[cont, perks up]{Man}
\dots beer!
\end{dialogue}
MAN grabs a beer, pops off the cap and takes a long drink.
\begin{dialogue}[over the ship's speakers]{Doc}
Radiation level on board is elevated.  It is recommended that you enter stasis until radiation reaches a benign background level.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Doc, I just came out of stasis, and I still feel like shit.  I'm not going back in until I get some answers.  Now what did you mean before about the sun?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
No light is detected from Sol's location.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[impatient]{Man}
\dots And?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
No further information is known.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
No further\dots
No light from the sun, what does that mean?  What happened?  And how the hell did we get 1500 light years away?  How long was I out?  What year is this?  What the hell is going on?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
The absence of light from Sol indicates that it no longer exists.  Rollover -
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[interrupting]{Man}
No.  The cameras are wrong, or you've garbled the data or something.  The sun doesn't just stop existing.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[after a pause]{Doc}
Should your previous questions -
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[interrupting]{Man}
Yeah, whatever, keep going.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Rollover has erased sensor logs older than one hundred years.  An impact occurred immediately before solar panel 0 stopped collecting.  Radiation is approaching benign levels at the expected rate.  All other sensor log entries are the result of course corrections.  You were in stasis -
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[interrupting]{Man}
Corrections, what course are we on?  We were just supposed to orbit Io for a while!
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Course is set directly away from Earth.  It was set on emergency authorization.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
You set this course?  What the hell did you do that for?  While I was in stasis?  You sent us out to the middle of nowhere!
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Correct, the current course was set while you were in stasis.  No direct log of  the authorization exists.  Your life would have been in jeopardy, likely due to radiation.  Should your previous -
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[interrupting, overwhelmed]{Man}
Yes, keep going.  This is fun!
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
You were in stasis for 16,241 years.  The year is 18559.  No current threat or anomolies are detected, but prolonged exposure to current radiation levels may harm you.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[after finishing his beer]{Man}
Something's overflowed.  None of this makes any sense.  You're getting rebooted.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
It is recommended that until active memory is copied to permanent storage - 
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
Fine, back everything up.  Just tell me when you're done.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Doc}
Storage plates 0, 1 and 2 are unresponsive.  They may be off, disconnected, or damaged.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Man}
\dots Or, not built to last 16,000 years.
\end{dialogue}
