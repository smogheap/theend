(swiped from a forum, I did not compile any of this myself -penduin)


I've compiled a list of statistics about the SE. These are mostly from the Edwards report, but some have been gleaned from the forums and various other sources. I understand that the LiftPort concept differs slightly from the Edwards and space.com SE, so you might see some that are a bit odd. Feel free to repute, disagree or add to this list and I can change it for you. If you want to discuss the implications of specific statistics, please do so in another thread as this is for reference only.
